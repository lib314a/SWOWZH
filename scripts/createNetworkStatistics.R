# Calculate network statistics 
#
# Two output files are created, one for the network with all three associative responses (R123)
# and one with only the first response.
#
# Datafiles are not part of this distribution and should be downloaded from the SWOW website
# https://smallworldofwords.org/project/research/
# The same function achieved in MATLAB pipeline is "centralityCalculating.m"
